Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This step involves understanding the dataset by cleaning, visualizing, and conducting preliminary analysis to identify patterns, outliers, and insights.
Measures of Central Tendency
This section calculates the mean, median, and mode of various features in the dataset.
Measures of Variability
This section calculates the range, variance, and standard deviation of various features in the dataset.
Hypothesis Testing
This section performs hypothesis tests to analyze relationships between variables, such as the association between team1 and the winner.
Correlation Analysis
This section explores correlations between numeric variables, such as win_by_runs and win_by_wickets.
Predictive Analysis
This section demonstrates a simple predictive analysis using a logistic regression model to predict the winner based on various features.
Conclusion and Insights
This section summarizes the findings and insights from the statistical analyses performed on the IPL cricket matches dataset.
